# termagotchi
Terminal-based Tamagotchi in Rust

## Description

For you zoomer millenials out there, a [tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) is a little device from back in the 90s that looked like a small egg with a screen and about three buttons. On the screen you had a virtual pet and you had to take care of it or it would die...

I made this as my first Rust project to see how the language works and stuff.

## Running
Right now this uses emojis so you'll need a terminal emulator that supports unicode.

Basically just `cargo run` and it will resize your terminal.

`Q` to quit. Other keys are on screen.

`cargo run -- -h` for help
`cargo run -- -n` for new game

## TODO
- Add actual pet art (ASCII probably) and animate it?
- Write tests (heh...)
- Maybe refactor stuff to make it more Rust-y

## Contribution
This is a beginner-friendly project so if you would like to add some features or fixes to it while you're learning Rust, or you REALLY like tamagotchi (uhh...) then feel free to make a PR.
